# HW-Data_Structures

## Objectives

- How to optimize python data processing
- How to optimize R data processing
- How to use AI to visualize the data

## Resources

- [One Billion Row Challenge](https://1brc.dev/)
- [Python implementation using different packages to improve](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-minutes-seconds-supercharging-python-billion-row-krishan-gupta-2icfe/)
- [Sorting one million](https://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2008/10/sorting-million-32-bit-integers-in-2mb.html)

## Homework

### Problem 1

- [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)
- [Binary subarrays with sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/)
  
### Problem 2

- Follow the instructions in [1brc](https://github.com/ifnesi/1brc#submitting) to create the data 
- Write Python code to print out the 25th,50th, 75th quantile of temperature per station, alphabetically ordered. (And try to make the processing fast)
- Write R code to print out the min, max, mean of temperature per station, alphabetically ordered. 
- With the help of AI, visualize the data in html. You have the flexibility to decide what to illustrate. You can refer to  [GWAS diverse monitor](https://gwasdiversitymonitor.com/)

## To Dos

- [ ] Specify the detailed instructions for the homework (format the output of the code so we can check the correctness and rank the performance automatically)

- [ ] For visualization, do we have better reference? I want them to make a R.shiny like interactive website with map visualization
