# HW-Sorting

## Objectives

- Implement three sorting algorithms
- How to optimize the python
- How to censor python learning time

## Resources

- [One Billion Row Challenge](https://1brc.dev/)
- [Python implementation using different packages to improve](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-minutes-seconds-supercharging-python-billion-row-krishan-gupta-2icfe/)
- [Sorting one million](https://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2008/10/sorting-million-32-bit-integers-in-2mb.html)

## Homework

- Sort the temperatures in 1brc by insert, merge, and choose their own. Use only python no external packages
- Use external packages like [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-minutes-seconds-supercharging-python-billion-row-krishan-gupta-2icfe/) to optimize the algorithms; Also try **pypy3**
- Use [viztracer](https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer) to see how different iterations of codes are improved; 
- Encourage them to use FAS-RC to do the homework

## To Dos

- Find other materials for the best way to optimize the sorting 
- Design the homework, add concrete instructions and code for data download and installation.
- Guidelines for the infrastructures needed (e.g., the cluster account set up, the IDE and python installations, job submissions)
